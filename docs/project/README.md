# ProjectBranch

## Project Overview

ProjectBranch creates a simple, friendly workspace for teams to read and edit
project files stored in `docs/project/` within GitHub repositories.

It is designed to support both technical and non-technical contributors by
combining a clean text-editing experience with a straightforward interface for
collaboration.

## Core Goals

- Let users read and update project documentation from one place.
- Enable pull-request based workflows for all project changes.
- Give agents direct access to documentation, future ideas, workflows, and user stories.
- Keep the experience easy for people who do not write code regularly.

## Why This Matters

Teams need a single workflow where planning, documentation, and execution stay
connected. By managing project knowledge in version-controlled docs, this
project helps everyone collaborate with clear history, review, and shared context.
